This is the **source code of S3M**, a spatially explicit and hydrology-oriented cryospheric model that successfully reconstructs seasonal snow and glacier evolution through time and that can be natively coupled with distributed hydrologic models. 

Model physics include precipitation-phase partitioning, snow and glacier energy and mass balances, snow rheology and hydraulics, and a data-assimilation protocol. 

S3M includes an explicit representation of the spatial patterns of snow liquid-water content, an hybrid approach to snowmelt that decouples the radiation- and temperature-driven contributions, the implementation of the Delta-h parametrization for distributed ice-thickness change, and the inclusion of a distributed debris-driven melt factor.
